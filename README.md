# Data-Cleaning-Unknown-File
This is my project from Upwork where I do data cleansing a corrupted file

## The Data Problem
* All Big Data problems involve the use of data sets to provide the raw values to build 
information about a particular entity.
* This information is often then used to model the entity so that a deeper analysis can be 
conducted into its behavior.
* Our problem involves the analysis of StarCraft2 Target data which will be used to assist AI 
developers in creating ‘intelligent’ game bots that can play against humans in Worldwide competitions.
* You can learn more about StarCraft2 AI competition here https://sc2ai.net/
* Our task is to utilize a text file containing corrupted StarCraft2 Target data and create a 
series of processes that will allow our AI bot engineers, here at Pace University, to better 
develop their bots.
